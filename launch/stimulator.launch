<!--
    ROSLAUNCH is a tool for easily launching multiple ROS nodes locally and remotely via SSH, as well as setting 
    parameters on the Parameter Server. It includes options to automatically respawn processes that have already 
    died. ROSLAUNCH takes in one or more XML configuration files (with the .launch extension) that specify the 
    parameters to set and nodes to launch, as well as the machines that they should be run on.
    ROSLAUNCH uses XML files that describe the nodes that should be run, parameters that should be set, and other 
    attributes of launching a collection of ROS nodes. For a specification of this XML format, please see:
    http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML
